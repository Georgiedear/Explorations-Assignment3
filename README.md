Made dummy look of open file page. Need to centre context, replace shapes with text
box and buttons and link to editing toolkit page.

Really wanted to figure out how to link to html pages together with P5.js instead of doing the old familiar html 5 way….it’s taken me a couple of hours..still no luck. 

I DID Manage to get mousePressed working. (A grey bar appears every time I click on the white bar…and the whole page.) 

Managed to clean up the tool kit layout.

The following links were used to help me understanding p5.js better and if I could figure out how to connect a link from one html to the other. (They helped my understand P5.js better but not so much with the latter…)
