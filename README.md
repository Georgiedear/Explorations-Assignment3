Made dummy look of open file page. Need to centre context, replace shapes with text
box and buttons and link to editing toolkit page.

Really wanted to figure out how to link to html pages together with P5.js instead of doing the old familiar html 5 way….it’s taken me a couple of hours..still no luck. 

_____________________________________________________________________________
I DID Manage to get mousePressed working. (A grey bar appears every time I click on the white bar…and the whole page.) 

Managed to clean up the tool kit layout.

The following links were used to help me understanding p5.js better and if I could figure out how to connect a link from one html to the other. (They helped my understand P5.js better but not so much with the latter…)

This processing link on hyperlinking (It also didn’t help);

-Organized the Open file box with html5 and P5.js
-Started looking into text input with P5.js. Went back to another ‘The Coding Train’ video on youtube:
1.3: Getting Text from User: Text Input - Programming with Text
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNQSVU0IKec

-I don’t actually plan to load PSD files on here but as a next test I will see if I can get this text box to find and load a png or jpg onto the next page (the actual toolkit interface.
Speaking of which! I need to add the rest of the divs and make it look better.(The div’s bag colours are only there to see how the divs are nested around each other.

Managed to get the text box ON TOP of the canvas. Finally starting to wrap my head around how P5.js’s DOM tagging works…
Time to link some strings and make an interactive webcomic! and make things slightly prettier.

All Action buttons are labeled and highlight when you hover over them. 
File, Preview and Upload are now on the interface.
